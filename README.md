# The DMV

This is the starter repo for the BE Mod1 DMV project.

### Iteration 1

### Reflection

Before moving on to the next portion of this iteration, reflect on your process of learning a new codebase. In your project’s README, reflect on the following:

1) Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.

I started by testing each Class individually to determine where to get started. I decided to start with facility.rb and skipped each test but the first. I slowly worked my way down using pry and rspec to find and eliminate bugs. It was a lot of trial and error but I eventually worked through all three of the iteration 1 tests.

2) What was hard about working with code you did not write?

It was certainly a new experience. The difficulty came from trying to figure out what the existing code was doing. I also was not familiar with 'before(:each) do' and started out just trying to figure out what it was doing. When you write all the code you generally have an idea of what it is all doing. But not in this case. 

3) What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?

Determining what did what was a relatively quick process. It certainly helps that we have been practicing tests for the last week and have an idea of what we are looking for. Also, having some good music on helps with any stress.
